# Coping Mechanisms for Music Players
Python scripts to help deal with the varying absurdities of music players. Except where otherwise specified, these scripts require the cat library, found in another reposatory. 

**Every Folder a Playlist:**

Some music players, especially those on so-called "smart" devices are unable to play from folders. This is a script that will walk through all the folders in a directory and make each one a playlist. Features a configuration file offering three options for dealing with subfolders, options for where to put playlists, what format to put playlists in, what to write to the playlists, and what to walk through.

**Playlist from Search:**

Searches though files and adds user-selected ones to a playlist. Searches are not case sensitive. Enter 'done' into the search to close the program. **WARNING**: Playlist may not update if the program is closed any other way. It will not overwrite exisiting playlists, but will add to them. Features an optional configuration file.
